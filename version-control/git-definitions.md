# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control keeps track of a project. It shows what has been updated/changed throughout a project's lifespan. It is useful because it can be used locally and remotely using GitHub. It can be branched and forked to different developers and merged into the master once features are made.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the master. One would use a branch to experiment/work on adding a feature. It essentially lets the master be working and clean.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save-point in the git workflow. Usually a commit is made when a feature is done or is at a point where we could revert to and work from there. If it is a final commit for a feature, that commit from a branch can be merged to the master branch.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is just as it sounds. It is a conflict when trying to merge two branches together. It can be the result of many scenarios.
